Here is a space for my thoughts.

A little bit about myself. I'm a Korean American in my 30s, living in sunny Southern California most of the year. On weekdays, I focus on making the web look cool and zippy so that people are more inclined to spend their finite resources on the web (sorry?). On weekends or whenever I'm pursuing anything personal, I like to go out running in nature while the sun paints the sky orange. Generally, I find joy in keeping things simple and clean, both in the physical and metaphysical world I'm involved in. While this world will stay consistently complex and unpredictable, I'm here to enjoy that as well.

So here goes!
