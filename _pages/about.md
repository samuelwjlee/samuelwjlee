This is a digital space where I share my thoughts, hoping someone out there would benefit from it.

A little bit about myself.

I'm a Korean American in my 30s, living in sunny Southern California most of the year. On weekdays, I focus on making the web look cool and zippy so that people are more inclined to spend thier resources on the web (sorry?). On weekends or whenever I'm free to pursue anything personal, one of the things I like to do is go out running in nature while the sun is painting the sky orange. Generally, I find joy in keeping things simple and clean, both in the physical and metaphysical world I'm involved in. While this world will stay consistently complex and unpredictable, I'm here to enjoy that as well.

So here goes!
